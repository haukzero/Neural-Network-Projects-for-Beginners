# Three Projects for AI Beginners

For AI beginners, project practice is a good way to consolidate what you have learned. Here, we will start with three classic neural network projects and learn how to use Pytorch to build our own neural network models.

## [Project 1 ---- MNIST](https://gitee.com/link-5/neural-netwrok-projects-for-beginners/blob/master/Project1%20MNIST/README.md)

## [Project 2 ---- Iris](https://gitee.com/link-5/neural-netwrok-projects-for-beginners/blob/master/Project2%20Iris/README.md)

## [Project 3 ---- Cat VS Dog](https://gitee.com/link-5/neural-netwrok-projects-for-beginners/blob/master/Project3%20Cat%20VS%20Dog/README.md)
