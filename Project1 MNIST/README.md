# Project 1 ---- MNIST

MNIST is a widely used dataset in the field of computer vision. It consists of 60,000 handwritten digit images for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel representation of a digit from 0 to 9. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately classify these digits. 

In this project, we will learn how to build our own neural network with Pytorch.

In the meantime, we will also learn:

- how to build a *Back Propagation Neural Network*(BPNN).

- how to build a *Convolutional Neural Network*(CNN).

- how to use *Long Short-Term Memory*(LSTM) in our model.

- how to use Dropout and Regularization to make our code more efficient.
